# SwiftOverCoffee3Challenge-BreathingApp

Apple Watcg Breathing App done in SwiftUI for the [Swift over Coffee challenge](https://twitter.com/swiftovercoffee/status/1234417974137802754).

I've also sprinkled with some continous haptic feedback. Took me over 1 hour tho, as I was getting used to SwiftUI
